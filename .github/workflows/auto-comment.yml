            ðŸ‘‹ Before you start, read the following guideline
            
            1. Generic code pointers in #59
            2. Give your branch a short and meaningful name, pull request title should be the same as your branch name
            3. Keep your pull request/commits small
            4. While working on the same issue, it is okay to have multiple branches. Second feature should be branched off first feature if there is a dependency. 
            5. In the commit message, prefix the message with `[#issueNumber]` like `[#1]` easy referencing.
            6. Once a pull request is opened, check the linter and the code you submitted (under changed `files` tab) to make sure everything is correct
            7. After revision, please re-request review by clicking on the circle next to reviewer names
            8. If the change has to do with UI, please include screenshots of the changed UI as part of the pull request
            9. If your feature branch is stale, always `rebase` instead of `merge`.
